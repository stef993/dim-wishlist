//notes: blueberries.gg/weapons/refusal-of-the-call-god-rolls/ PvE Roll: All-Around (A) "As the goal is to swap to Refusal after landing a kill with a different weapon, boosting our handling is top priority. Tempered Truss Rod, Swap Mag, and a handling masterwork should do you just fine. Discord has barely any contenders in its slot. While Envious Assassin and Replenishing Aegis are nice, Discord refunds the ammo from thin air, instead of pulling from reserves. Slice is the only other worthwhile perk as it can make those close-up encounters less stressful. As for Perk 2, Sword Logic just pairs so well with Discord that other options seem lackluster.

Ballistic Tuning, Accurized Rounds, and a range masterwork will give it a solid bump and will make our perk 1 choice even stronger. Speaking of, Impulse Amplifier is that perk. Tacking on the 35% bonus gives Refusal a whopping 175 m/s projectile velocity! And while it might seem like an odd choice, Disruption Break for Perk 2 is actually a very solid pick. As the glaive melee is coded as a Kinetic attack, it will benefit from the 50% damage debuff, allowing for a shot-melee kill at all resilience tiers!" Masterwork	Range tags:god-pvp

//notes: blueberries.gg/weapons/crimils-dagger-god-rolls/ PvE Roll: All-Around (C) "We recommend Fluted Barrel, as it provides a much-needed boost to the weapons’ Stability and Handling, and Tactical Mag, as it also provides Stability while helping with the Reload Speed of 120 Hand Cannons. Enlightened Action is recommended for the same reason, helping with the Reload Speed and also providing a much-needed boost to the Handling of the weapon. Explosive Payload is a good option in general as it boosts the weapon’s total damage output and also negates the majority of damage drop-off.

We recommend Slideways as it provides a +20 stat boost to Stability and Handling (+25 Enhanced), and also partially refills the magazine which is very useful on 120 Hand Cannons due to the slow reload speed. Moving Target can also be used, sacrificing the boost to Stability and Handling for an increase in Aim Assist, making it much easier to hit your shots, allowing for more consistent 3 shot kills. We recommend Adagio, especially in 6v6 playlists. This is due to a relatively recent buff to 120 RPM Hand Cannons, where Precision Instrument is no longer required for 2 Headshot 1 Bodyshot kills. Adagio has very high potential as once active, it can kill in just 2 Headshots, with a 0.6 second time to kill. Zen Moment is also a viable option as it increases the weapon’s Stability, making it much easier to hit follow up shots. Range masterwork is preferred as the boost provides nearly 1.5m of extra range, and once Slideways has been activated, the low Stability and Handling becomes less of an issue due to the stat boost.

CtM is perfect if you want to take full advantage of the combo buff, and Desperate Measures can quickly get to max stacks as the glaive melee counts towards all of it. However, Desperate Measures (like most damage perks) does not buff the melee itself, so keep that in mind." Masterwork	Range tags:pve

Slice, on the other hand, will let you lower another guardian’s damage by 15%, keeping you and teammates alive longer. Perk 2 is also lacking, with Swashbuckler and Deconstruct being the best possible. Swash can net you the swap kill, but only if you hit for max damage.

High-Caliber Rounds is always amazing as it staggers enemies in PvE, making them more vulnerable. However, Ricochet Rounds is also a decent option. For perk 1, we suggest Overflow or Field Prep. Both are very good options and you can’t go wrong with either. For perk slot 2, Jolting Feedback is our winner, but Killing Tally and Rolling Storm are also acceptable." Masterwork	Range tags:pve

That all said, the majority of perks in this pool are S-tier picks for PvP (Moving Target, Lone Wolf, Eye of the Storm, and Magnificent Howl, to name a few more), so there’s tons of wiggle room here."

A reload speed masterwork will help round out the stats. For Perk 1, a lot of good options are here, but Destabilizing Rounds or Firefly are easily the best. Both play very well into both of our slot 2 options, and Destabilizing Rounds now grants Volatile Rounds directly to the gun! Perk 2 also has strong contenders, but Killing Tally or One-For-All take the cake.

In perk slot 2, you can opt for High Ground or Withering Gaze. High Ground is the best pick, as it will give you a damage bonus when above your enemy, which is always welcome."

// Lotus-Eater (pve)
//notes: blueberries.gg/weapons/lotus-eater-god-rolls/ PvE Roll: All-Around (S) "Starting off our PvE Roll, we’ve opted for Quick Launch as it provides a solid bump to Velocity, and a healthy increase to Handling which is always appreciated on Special weapons. This Velocity is further increased by High-Explosive Ordnance and a Velocity Masterwork. Our magazine choice also has the added benefit of slightly boosting our Blast Radius. Perk slot 1 has a plethora of brilliant options. While we have chosen Repulsor Brace as our main pick, it is tough to ignore Feeding Frenzy and Reconstruction. If you don’t want to fully lean into a Void build, one of those reload perks will serve you well. Perk slot 2 comes with the perk on everybody’s lips: Destabilizing Rounds. This is brilliant when paired with Repulsor Brace, but it also works well alone. However, if you want to forgo the Volatile capabilities of the perk, you can opt for Withering Gaze and treat Lotus-Eater as a utility pick rather than an add-clearing tool."

High-Caliber Rounds is generally a good pick as it increases flinch, but Ricochet Rounds provides more Stability, so both are viable. For perk 1, we recommend Dynamic Sway Reduction simply because it makes the weapon more accurate. For perk 2, Sword Logic is ideal thanks to its 20% damage bonus on kill, which can grant you a 4-headshot kill on enemies with Tier 8 Resilience or lower." Masterwork	Stability tags:god-pvp

// Refusal of the Call (pve) (Adept Holofoil)
//notes: blueberries.gg/weapons/refusal-of-the-call-god-rolls/ PvE Roll: All-Around (A) "As the goal is to swap to Refusal after landing a kill with a different weapon, boosting our handling is top priority. Tempered Truss Rod, Swap Mag, and a handling masterwork should do you just fine. Discord has barely any contenders in its slot. While Envious Assassin and Replenishing Aegis are nice, Discord refunds the ammo from thin air, instead of pulling from reserves. Slice is the only other worthwhile perk as it can make those close-up encounters less stressful. As for Perk 2, Sword Logic just pairs so well with Discord that other options seem lackluster. However, Close to Melee is a solid alternative as it too can take advantage of Discord’s ammo refund." Masterwork	Handling tags:pve

//notes: blueberries.gg/weapons/corrective-measure-god-rolls/ PvE Roll: All-Around (A) "For some ease-of-use, we’ll be throwing on Fluted Barrel to bump the handling and stability a bit. As for the magazine, Appended Mag is the best choice here. Tactical Mag looks enticing, but the middling amount of ammo it gives is not worth the stat boosts. A reload speed masterwork will help round out the stats. For Perk 1, a lot of good options are here, but Destabilizing Rounds or Firefly are easily the best. Both play very well into both of our slot 2 options, and Destabilizing Rounds now grants Volatile Rounds directly to the gun! Perk 2 also has strong contenders, but Killing Tally or One-For-All take the cake.

Throw on a stability masterwork to make this akin to a laser beam. Perks 1 and 2 will be the tried and true Dynamic Sway Reduction and High-Impact Reserves.

// Psychopomp (pve) (Adept Holofoil)
//notes: blueberries.gg/weapons/psychopomp-god-rolls/ PvE Roll: All-Around (S) "Our roll on Psychopomp is gearing it towards being used as a DPS option, so Quick Launch and High-Velocity Rounds are ideal here, thanks to the Handling and Velocity they provide. In Perk 1, you can choose whether to use this weapon as a DPS option with Envious Arsenal or an add-clear option with Ambitious Assassin; the choice is yours, depending on what you wish your Psychopomp to accomplish. For Perk 2, we suggest Rolling Storm as it gives you a way to utilize Bolt Charge; however, Frenzy is a very suitable alternative, especially if you are using this weapon for add-clear."

// Fatebringer (god-pve) (TIMELOST)
//notes: blueberries.gg/weapons/fatebringer-god-rolls/ PvE Roll: All-Around (S) "For our barrel, we are going to opt for Smallbore. However, you can most likely go for any option, as barrels in PvE aren’t too important on primary weapons. For the magazine, Appended Mag is ideal to bump that magazine size up from 10 to 12. For Perk 1, Explosive Payload is the clear winner as it provides good utility to the weapon while also dealing slightly more damage. In Perk 2, you have some more choice. Frenzy is ideal, thanks to its damage and stat bonuses, but Firefly or even Elemental Honing can work too." Masterwork	Range tags:god-pve

// Fatebringer (god-pvp) (TIMELOST)
//notes: blueberries.gg/weapons/fatebringer-god-rolls/ PvP Roll: All-Around (A) "Barrels are more important in PvP, so we should shoot for Smallbore here, although you can also opt for other Range-improving barrels. For our magazine, we are looking for Accurised Rounds to boost the range as far as possible. n perk slot 1, Explosive Payload and Opening Shot are the ideal picks, and what you choose will come down to personal preference. However, in Perk 2, Eye of the Storm is the best pick. While Magnificent Howl is an okay alternative, Eye of the Storm is consistently too good." Masterwork	Range tags:god-pvp

//notes: blueberries.gg/armor/relativism-god-rolls/ "The combination of Spirit of Caliban and Spirit of the Liar is a pretty deadly combo as it takes the incredibly high damage from Liar’s Handshake and the explosive capabilities of Caliban’s Hand and meshes them together to create one of the best AoE, high damage builds in the entire game. The Combination Blow and Gambler’s Dodge loop works perfectly with this build and allows you to dive into the fight, deal ridiculous melee damage against a tanky enemy, and watch the enemies around it ignite in a high-damage explosion."
dimwishlist:item=2809120022&perks=3751917996,3751917992

//notes: blueberries.gg/armor/relativism-god-rolls/ "This combination is geared much more towards PvP players, as it massively improves the neutral game by taking the high handling speed bonus of Ophidian Aspect on Warlock and pairing it with Wormhusk’s Crown’s heal-on-dodge. This combo is a major quality-of-life roll, and is brilliant for Hunters that want some direct bonuses without having to worry about build crafting."
dimwishlist:item=2809120022&perks=1476923954,3751917991

//notes: blueberries.gg/armor/relativism-god-rolls/ "Spirit of Renewal and Spirit of the Cyrtarachne will allow you to turn into the tankiest Hunter the world has ever seen. By using Duskfield Grenades alongside this combo, throwing a Duskfield at your feet will grant you Woven Mail from Cyrtarachne and damage-reducing properties of Duskfield Grenades, when combined with Renewal, will make you outrageously tanky."

//notes: blueberries.gg/armor/solipsism-god-rolls/ "Combining the effects of Heart of Inmost Light and Verity’s Brow, this roll is easily the strongest for general gameplay and can complement any build or loadout you pair it with. With both enhanced ability regeneration and bonus grenade damage, this roll could even be considered a build simply on its own."
dimwishlist:item=2273643087&perks=1476923953,1476923957

//notes: blueberries.gg/armor/solipsism-god-rolls/ "While slightly more niche in its use cases, this roll is outstanding when paired with a melee-focused build. Karnstein Armlets do give this combination a run for its money, but there’s definitely room for both to shine in today’s meta."

//notes: blueberries.gg/armor/solipsism-god-rolls/ "This final roll is primarily meant for boss damage scenarios. Spirit of the Star-Eater offers increased Super damage, which can then be followed by Spirit of Apotheosis’ increased ability regeneration after using your Super."
dimwishlist:item=2273643087&perks=183430250,1476923955


//notes: blueberries.gg/armor/stoicism-god-rolls/ "This combo is the more survivable version of Spirit of Inmost Light and Synthoceps. The invisibility from Assassin will activate on Consecration slams, allowing you to get away safely after slamming down with your Solar attack. Synthoceps is again present as a damage-boosting source, allowing you to take down some tankier targets."
dimwishlist:item=266021826&perks=1476923952,1476923956

//notes: blueberries.gg/armor/stoicism-god-rolls/ "This combo wants to focus on the Unbreakable Aspect, utilizing the bonus damage from Verity combined with the super regeneration properties of Bear. This combo allows you to chunk a target after using your Unbreakable Grenade while also regenerating super energy constantly. Pair this with a Void Demolitionist weapon and Grenade-regenerating mods, and you will have a loop that is incredibly satisfying and fun to do, all while holding the frontline with your Unbreakable shield."

//notes: https://www.blueberries.gg/weapons/something-new-god-rolls/ class B "For PvE, our primary goal is to make the weapon feel smoother to use. As a result, we’ll opt for Fluted Barrel, Tactical Mag, and either a handling or stability masterwork (purely dependent on your preference).

// Fortunate Star (god-pve)
//notes: https://www.blueberries.gg/weapons/fortunate-star-god-rolls/ class A "With a combination of Agile Bowstring, Compact Arrow Shaft, and Handling Masterwork, we can boost Fortunate Star to a smooth 100 handling that feels lovely to use. We like the Void Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds combo for our perk combinations. Destabilizing Rounds provides some AoE through the volatile explosions, allowing it to clear out groups of enemies more efficiently than just firing the bow itself. However, if you aren’t interested in leaning fully into Void, Archer’s Tempo and Golden Tricorn are acceptable alternatives due to the draw speed from Archer’s Tempo and up to a 50% damage buff with Golden Tricorn."

We also dip into Draw Time with our Draw Time Masterwork and Veist Stinger Origin Trait, which massively improves the feel of the weapon. Hip-Fire Grip and Opening Shot are both very consistent additions to the weapon, making it feel much easier to use.

// Crowning Duologue (god-pve)
//notes: https://www.blueberries.gg/weapons/crowning-duologue-god-rolls/ class A "Quick Launch is the best barrel option here, thanks to the healthy boost to velocity and handling it provides. Given that we are opting for Bait and Switch, having good Handling is key so we can swap quickly, so a Handling Masterwork is nice to have, too. Reconstruction is definitely the ideal option for perk slot one, but Auto-Loading Holster is an acceptable replacement. Bait and Switch is the go-to for perk slot two, though, as it provides a 30% damage bonus." Masterwork: Handling (also good: Velocity) tags:god-pve

// Compass Rose (god-pve)
//notes: https://www.blueberries.gg/weapons/compass-rose-god-rolls/ class B "Fluted Barrel and Tactical Mag are the best picks for our Barrel and Magazine as they help boost our Handling and Reload Speed, respectively. This, combined with a Handling Masterwork, makes Compass Rose feel very nice to use.

// Compass Rose (god-pvp)
//notes: https://www.blueberries.gg/weapons/compass-rose-god-rolls/ class S "The barrel choice on this Shotgun is incredibly interesting. While we think Smallbore is the safest option all-around due to the small bump to Stability and Range, there is an argument to be made for Full Bore. Slickdraw boosts our Handling high enough, and the extra range from Full Bore could be good, too. Fluted Barrel is another option that is good if you decide to go for Threat Detector over Slickdraw so you have better base handling. Accurised Rounds is a no-brainer for the magazine slot due to the flat increase in Compass Rose’s range. Slickdraw is a very exciting perk to have on a Shotgun because it boosts our Handling to 100 while also improving the ready animation speed. However, if you don’t like the feel of Slickdraw, Threat Detector is a suitable alternative. Opening Shot is the winner in the second perk slot because it maxes out our range stat, capping it at 6.71m. However, Snapshot Sights is a personal favorite of mine as it simply makes any and all weapons feel amazing to use, so definitely consider that as an alternative." Masterwork	Range tags:god-pvp

//notes: https://www.blueberries.gg/weapons/hung-jury-god-rolls/ 3v3 Modes "Maximising Stability is the most important thing on PvP weapons, especially in Trials where missing a shot could wind up losing your team the round, meaning Fluted Barrel, Steady Rounds, and a Stability Masterwork are preferable. In terms of perks, Rapid Hit is still the go-to option due to its Reload Speed and Stability bumps. Box Breathing is the best option for Trials, as perks that activate after a kill are often weaker in these sorts of environments. Cascade Point can be used as an okay alternative, but Box Breathing is preferred." MW: Stability tags:god-pvp

Rapid Hit is a good quality-of-life perk, providing bumps to Reload Speed and Stability. In 6v6, pairing this with Cascade Point allows you to go on killing sprees very easily, dropping the time-to-kill to 0.6s, which is blindingly fast. Box Breathing is a good alternative, but it may be too slow for a more chaotic 6v6 environment. However, on larger maps, Box Breathing can do very well." MW: Stability tags:god-pvp

The first perk doesn’t matter too much, as the main draw of this version of Falling Guillotine is the movement capabilities of Eager Edge. However, Frenzy and Relentless Strikes are both the best options available in the first column.

Its amazing base stats means not much needs to be kicked up, but its handling is objectively sub-par, so we’ll use Fluted Barrel to kick it up a notch. Pair it with Flared Magwell for a reload speed buff, as well as a slight stability bump. For perk 1, it’s a “no contest” for Kinetic Tremors. Shoot to Loot, while nice to have, feels like a waste when a free damage perk is in the same slot. Since Blast Furnace fires 4 shots a burst, it’ll only take 3 bursts to activate it, as opposed to 4 on all others. Perk 2 has a lot of good in it, but it’s a toss-up between Desperate Measures and One-For-All.

Speaking of our perk choices, we’re going for the classic combo of Reconstruction and Recombination. While Firing Line is a close contender in the second column (if you’re in a fireteam), Recombination’s buffed shot is simply too potent in such a wide range of scenarios.

// Blast Furnace - 6v6s God Roll (god-pvp) (Holofoil)
//notes: https://www.blueberries.gg/weapons/blast-furnace-god-rolls/ 6v6s "PvP is where Blast Furnace will shine. A base of 79 range and 64 stability puts it above all other pulses in its frame, with the only downside being the base 65 recoil, but that’s easily fixable with Arrowhead Break, which will put it to 95 before a Counterbalance Stock mods bumps it to 100. Accurized Rounds will provide a +10 to your range, which is perfect for fighting longer range weapons. In 6v6 modes, you’ll find more use in Keep Away or Perpetual Motion given how they play. Keep Away gives a nice range buff, but Perpetual Motion gives you free stability for simply moving around. For Perk 2, any of the kill-based perks will work best, but Kill Clip and Rampage will probably be the easiest to use. Desperate Measures gets an honorable mention, too."

//notes: https://www.blueberries.gg/weapons/elsies-rifle-god-rolls/ 3v3 (Trials) "High-Impacts continue to dominate the sandbox, so it’s only right that we beef this one up as much as possible. Arrowhead Break is your best barrel since the max range roll only pushes the effective TTK range by 2 meters, and being able to actually hit your shots is more important than how far they can hit. Pair with Ricochet Rounds for even more stability and a slight range bump.

//notes: https://www.blueberries.gg/weapons/midnight-coup-god-rolls/ All-Around "As always, Fluted Barrel is the go-to for our barrel option as it provides a good amount of Handling, making the weapon feel much nicer. On top of this, we can opt for Appended Mag as we already have Reload Speed from either Firefly or Frenzy, no matter which alternate perk you go for. Firefly provides some much-needed AoE damage as Hand Cannons typically struggle with add-clear, but Explosive is a decent utility-based alternative. Frenzy is generally the best all-round option as it also works with Explosive Payload, but One for All has great synergy with Firefly, making it a valid alternative when paired with an AoE perk.

Perk 1 has solid PvP options, but only one really good perk for PvE: Heal Clip. Now that this heals 120 HP instead of the 60 it used to, Heal Clip is perfect for survivability builds.

Speaking of our perk choices, we’re going for the classic combo of Reconstruction and Recombination.
